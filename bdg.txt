Badarganj is an upazila in the Rangpur District of Bangladesh, known for its rich cultural heritage, 
agricultural economy, and historical significance. Covering an area of about 301 square kilometers, 
it is bordered by several other upazilas and is traversed by rivers like the Jamuneshwari and Chirnai. 
The area is predominantly rural, with agriculture serving as the main livelihoodâ€”producing crops such as rice, 
jute, and potatoes. Badarganj is named after the mystic saint Hazrat Badaruddin Shah, whose tomb remains a 
spiritual site in the region. The upazila played a notable role in historical movements, including anti-British
 rebellions and the 1971 Liberation War, during which it briefly became a free zone. It is home to significant
  Mughal-era structures like the Nine-domed Mosque and Laldighi Mosque, as well as cottage industries that
   reflect local craftsmanship. Despite a literacy rate below the national average, Badarganj hosts numerous 
   schools and colleges, and its local economy is supported by institutions like the Shyampur Sugar Mills. 
   The upazila reflects the blend of tradition, resistance, and rural life characteristic of northern Bangladesh.



   Taraganj is a small but significant upazila located in the Rangpur District of northern Bangladesh. 
   Known for its strategic location along the Rangpur-Dinajpur highway, Taraganj serves as an important 
   transit and trading hub in the region. The upazila spans a mostly flat and fertile landscape, making 
   agriculture the backbone of its economy, with rice, jute, and potatoes being the main crops. Taraganj 
   is also recognized for the Taraganj Haat, a large traditional market that draws traders and buyers from 
   surrounding areas. The area has a mix of rural charm and growing development, with basic educational and
    healthcare facilities gradually improving. Culturally, Taraganj reflects the rich traditions of Rangpur,
     with festivals, folk practices, and community gatherings playing a central role in daily life. Despite 
     its relatively small size, Taraganj continues to evolve, contributing to the socio-economic fabric of 
     the greater Rangpur region.
